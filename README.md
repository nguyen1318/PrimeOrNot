or not prime.

Build and link the file by running:
<br />
	(First run this) nasm -felf lab.7asm -o lab7.o
  <br />
	(Then run this) ld -melf_i386 lab7.o lab7
<br />
<br />
Run the file:
	./lab7

A blank line will appear, enter any non-negative number to determine whether it is
prime or not. Enter 0 to exit.
